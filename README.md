# Internship Project
A 5 months-long small full-stack project I developed as an intern.

This project consists of a form for hotel rooms revervations which redirects its data to another webpage, and an editor of its visual components.
It features a real-time preview of the modifications and a database that can save multiple profiles and create "clients" to which those profiles are associated.

As it is developed currently, this project requires a local server and that the files are opened through 'localhost'. The server access credentials must also be the default ones:

```
host: localhost/127.0.0.1
user: root
password: (blank)
```

XAMPP is recommended, as it was what it was used when developing this system.

(A limitation of the software is that images that are to be applied to the form must be in the 'img' folder contained in the project)
