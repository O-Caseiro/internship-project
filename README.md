# internship-project
Small full-stack project I developed as an intern for 5 months.

This project consists of and editor of the visual presentation of hotel room reservations form.
It features a real-time preview of the modifications and a database that can save multiple profiles and
create "clients" to which those profiles are associated with.

As it is developed currently, this project requires a local server and that the files are opened through 'localhost'.
XAMPP is recommended, as it was what it was used when developing this system.
